KRYOTHERM TGM-199-1.4-0.8 thermoelectric generator module Simulink model. This model uses data presented in the manufacturer’s data for cold surface temperatures of 30°C, 50°C, and 80°C. The hot surface temperature value can be in the range of [40 220]. The model gives the most accurate results for a cold surface temperature of 30 °C, 50 °C, or 80 °C. The model produces approximate results at other cold surface temperature values.

The open circuit voltage and short circuit current error rates of the designed TEG module are 0.125% and 0.256%, respectively. The MAPE values of the designed model are 0.5104%, 0.7837%, and 2.0952% for 30 ◦ C, 50 ◦ C, and 80 ◦ C cold surface temperatures, respectively.
