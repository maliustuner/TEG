MATLAB/Simulink model of TGM-199-1.4-0.8 Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) module

Simulink model of KRYOTHERM TGM-199-1.4-0.8 thermoelectric generator module.

KRYOTHERM TGM-199-1.4-0.8 thermoelectric generator module Simulink model. This model uses data presented in the manufacturer’s data for cold surface temperatures of 30°C, 50°C, and 80°C. The hot surface temperature value can be in the range of [40 220]. The model gives the most accurate results for a cold surface temperature of 30 °C, 50 °C, or 80 °C. The model produces approximate results at other cold surface temperature values.
